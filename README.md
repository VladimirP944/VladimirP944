# Hi there üëã I'm Vlad!

I am a junior Full Stack Developer. Fresh out from the best IT bootcamp in Romania, that is Codecool. <br>
I spent an entire year(2021 - 2022) learning how to code and thanks to Codecool I became proficient in many technologies. Over the past year I worked in teams and also on solo projects and became comfortable working with Java, Spring Boot, Python, Javascript, React, CSS, Postgresql, Docker, Git and then some. 
<br>I developed a strong sense of the OOP concepts and principles and always cared about having a clean code (easy to read == easy to maintain) üòÅ .
<br>My main projects are here, I will be happy to talk about them if given the chance.
I want to be honest, I still have technologies to learn and skills to master, one year of intense learning (mostly coding 6-8h/day), created my foundation for this career but my aim is high and I am eager to learn more.

**Update 1.0:

Since september 2022 i was given a chance to work at UST Romania as a data engineer. 
2 months into the job I can say that I met cool people, I myself continued to grow along them, taking my first certification with AWS
and learning how to leverage the snowflake platform for data extractions, ETL, data warehousing and some other tools for Master Data Management and also data lakes.
